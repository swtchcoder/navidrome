###  Supported Subsonic API endpoints

Navidrome is currently compatible with [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) v1.8.0, with some exceptions.

This is an (almost) up to date list of all Subsonic API endpoints implemented by Navidrome. 
Check the "Notes" column for limitations/missing behaviour. Also keep in mind these differences between 
Navidrome and Subsonic:

* Right now, Navidrome only works with a single Music Library (Music Folder)
* Navidrome does not mark songs as played by calls to `stream`, only when 
 `scrobble` is called with `submission=true`
* Next features to be implemented: Last.FM integration, Jukebox, Sharing, Bookmarks, Podcasts, Internet Radio. 

Navidrome is actively being tested with:
[DSub](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#dsub),
[Music Stash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghenry22.mymusicstash) and
[Jamstash](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#jamstash))
