- Multi-platform, runs on macOS, Linux and Windows. Docker images are also provided
- Ready to use Raspberry Pi binaries available
- Automatically monitors your library for changes, importing new files and reloading new metadata 
- Modern and responsive Web interface based on Material UI, to manage users and browse your library
- Compatible with all Subsonic/Madsonic/Airsonic clients. See bellow for a list of tested clients

## Road map

This project is being actively worked on. Expect a more polished experience and new features/releases 
on a frequent basis. Some upcoming features planned: 

- Last.FM integration
- Smart/dynamic playlists (similar to iTunes)
- Support for audiobooks (bookmarking)
- Jukebox mode
- Sharing links to albums/songs/playlists
- Podcasts


## Installation

Various options are available:

### Pre-built executables

Just head to the [releases page](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/releases) and download the latest version for you 
platform. There are builds available for Linux (amd64 and arm), macOS and Windows (32 and 64 bits). 
For Raspberry Pi (tested with Raspbian Buster on Pi 4), use the Linux arm builds.

Remember to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in your system, a requirement for Navidrome to work 
properly. You may find the latest static build for your platform here: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ 

If you have any issues with these binaries, or need a binary for a different platform, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/issues) 

### Docker

[Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/deluan/navidrome) are available. They include everything needed 
to run Navidrome. Example of usage:

```yaml
# This is just an example. Customize it to your needs.

version: "3"
services:
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    ports:
      - "4533:4533"
    environment:
      # All options with their default values:
      ND_MUSICFOLDER: /music
      ND_DATAFOLDER: /data
      ND_SCANINTERVAL: 1m
      ND_LOGLEVEL: info  
      ND_PORT: 4533
      ND_TRANSCODINGCACHESIZE: 100MB
      ND_SESSIONTIMEOUT: 30m
    volumes:
      - "./data:/data"
      - "/path/to/your/music/folder:/music:ro"
```

To get the cutting-edge, latest version from master, use the image `deluan/navidrome:develop`

### Build from source

You will need to install [Go 1.14](https://golang.org/dl/) and [Node 13.10.1](http://nodejs.org).
You'll also need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) installed in your system. The setup is very strict, and 
the steps bellow only work with these specific versions (enforced in the Makefile) 

After the prerequisites above are installed, clone this repository and build the application with:

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/deluan/navidrome
$ cd navidrome
$ make setup        # Install tools required for Navidrome's development 
$ make buildall     # Build UI and server, generates a single executable
```

This will generate the `navidrome` executable binary in the project's root folder. 

### Running for the first time

Start the server with:
```shell script
./navidrome
```
The server should start listening for requests on the default port __4533__

After starting Navidrome for the first time, go to http://localhost:4533. It will ask you to create your first admin 
user.

For more options, run `navidrome --help` 

### Running as a service

Check the [contrib](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/tree/master/contrib)
folder for startup files for your init system.
